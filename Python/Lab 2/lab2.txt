MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS INSIDE A FUNCTION, in the lab only execute/comment the functions calls


1 - Fill an array of 5 elements from the user, Sort it in descending and ascending orders then display the output.
2 - Write a function that accepts two arguments (length, start) to generate an array of a specific length filled with integer numbers increased by one from start.
3 - Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user
	    enters “done”. Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the numbers.
	    If the user enters anything other than a number, detect their
            mistake, print an error message and skip to the next number.

Bonus:
4 - discuss why dictionary key can only be an immutable type, how the set makes sure it has non-duplicates
